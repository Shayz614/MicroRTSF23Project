# microrts-f23

This is a repo with solutions to the microRTS game. Each member has a folder containing their bot, the unit test file, diff file and documentation. Also included are the presentations, tournament results and the prototype MINS_Bot from which we built up our bots.

## Project Flow

We initially started by collectively creating a simple prototype bot. The microRTS library is large and complicated, so we used this prototype to develop our understanding of the project structure and the functions and algorithms included in the library. We then began implementing individual strategies, building upon the foundation of the prototype MINS_Bot. Specific details on individual bots can be found in the documentation within each member's folder.
